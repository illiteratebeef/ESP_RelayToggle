This is a program to toggle a pin on and off whenever the device recieved any kind of http request request. It's best to run this on an ESP8266 with the most recent NodeMCU firmware and using ESPlorer to program it. 

Bugs fixed: 
removed old file.writeline formatting


To Do:
Server crashes after ~5 minutes, make it not do that.
